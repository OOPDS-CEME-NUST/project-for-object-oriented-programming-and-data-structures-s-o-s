# Traffic_Management-OpenCV
The following code is for a traffic management software. The code prioritizes lanes according to number of cars in those respective lanes.
The code has been divided into two parts: 
                                          1: The part that counts the number of cars in all lanes. 
                                          2: The part that calculates each signal time using this car count. 
COUNTING CARS: This program has been developed using c++ and OpenCV.lib. Blob detection has been used for counting number of cars. 
SIGNAL TIME: This is a simple C++ code that uses the car count to generate a ON time for each signal.
