The following program is for the signal time. 

The code consists of following files: 

carCount.h
carCount.cpp
signalTime.h
signalTime.cpp
signalCirculation.h
signalCirculation.cpp

carCount: carCount.h & carCount.cpp are used for getting & displaying total number of cars. 

signalTime: signalTime.h & signalTime.cpp calculates the respective signal time for each lane. The code used bubble wrap to sort out the number of cars in ascending order and then assign each lane a calculated time depending on the number of cars. 

signalCirculation: This part of the code uses the calculated times and keeps the signal circulating.
